            <h3>  Development and Execution of Comprehensive and Integrated Subterranean Intelligent Vehicle Evaluations (DECISIVE) Summer 2020 to Fall 2022</h3>
            <p>Working Under: Professor Kshitij Jerath and Professor Jay Weitzen </p>
            <p>Lab: EXALABS and NERVE </p>
            <p>
              The US Army funded this project whose goal was to derive a a series of testing evaluation for underground Small Unamanned Aerial Systems (sUAS).
              The tests are for chategories such as: Navigation, Collision Tolerance, Communication, Trust, Automation, and Mapping.
              The current state of the art exists only in above ground testing the NIST handbook is only for that. These tests take into account the conditions 
              of undergroudn environments. These special conditions are caused by the cramped spaces which complicate all the test chategories. Navigation is more
              complicated in underground environments because more obstacles make paths that the drones have to follow very exact because small deviations can lead to collisions.
              Collision Tolerance is not a test parameter in above ground testing because the NIST handbook requires big and open spaces to do testing where there would not 
              be any collisions to start off. Communications become very interesting due to the fact that cramped spaces impede messaging and can even cause signals to reflect on
              the walls. Trust is more complicated in the underground cases because a human might perceived flying a drone underground near humans as risky and dangerous. Automation 
              needs to take into account all the possible collisions to be able to fly the drone safely throught the space. Finally mapping is difficult due to the fact that there are
              a lot more objects to pick up and properly find its distances.
            </p>
            <p>
              My personal contribution to this project was mainly concentrated on the Navigation and Collision Tolerance but I also did work in Communication and Trust portions
              of the projects. (Please see papers related to this project)
            </p>
            
          <h3>  Smart Grids Summer 2022 </h3>
            <p>Working Under: Professor Vinod Vokkarane and Professor Yuzhang Lin </p>
            <p>
              Smart Grids require good methods to try to detect DDOS attacks on the grids. KDDCup’99 and CICIDS’17 datasets were used to simulate DDOS attacks on a grid.
              Machine Learning Algorithms such as Decision Tree, Random Forest, Quadratic Discriminant Analysis, Support Vector Machine, Naïve Bayes, and Extreme Gradient Boosting
              were test and compared for the algorithm that is simulatneously the most accurate, the quickest, and that consumes the smallest amount of space on a processor. The
               final metric about memory consumption is critical because this method will be further expanded in future project on a vastly distributed grid and memory cost is a 
              factor.
            </p>
            <p>
              This was a part of a larger project for full decentralized smart grids. This evaluation of ML methods was done with the aid of another undergrad (Please see the
              associated paper)
            </p>
            
          <h3>  FDA Indel Study </h3>
            <p>Working Under: Professor Dalila Megherbi </p>
            <p>Lab: CMINDS </p>
            <p>
              Indel refer to insertions and Deletions in DNA. Very little work has been done to charaterise the difference between Somatic and Germline Indels. The first refers
              to new indel that have not been inherited while the latter refers to inherited indels. The goal of this work was to move towards algorithms that could help determine
              and sort indels in DNA into the two chategories.
            </p>
            <p>
              My personal contributions was aiding in developing a full characterized dataset of all the indels the FDA wanted to process. Along with other reviewers we systematically
              went through all necessary datapoints to determine if in actuallity there were true indels in those locations and the type of indel they were. This was then used in the
              necessary algorithms to train on. Please see upcoming paper on the topic.
            </p>
            
          <h3>  Drone Swarming Fall 2019 to Summer 2022 in Simulation and Real Life</h3>
            <p>Lab: EXALABS and NERVE </p>
            <p>
              Using the simulator Airsim and Crazyflie Drones swarms of drones were settup to fly in large groups. This was using both PID controllers and Couzin Swarming algorithm
              to make sure the group followed the necessary dynamic structure. This structure is one where many drones can fly together but still stay distant. 
            </p>
            <p>
              I was put to work on this project in simulation at first and then reimplemented the same in the lab using crazyflie drones. Please see Airsim section for more details.

              DECISIVE Test Methods Handbook: Test Methods for Evaluating sUAS in Subterranean and Constrained Indoor Environments, Version 1.1 (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01801">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01801</a>)
            </p>
            <p>
              This handbook outlines all test methods developed under the Development and Execution of Comprehensive and Integrated Subterranean Intelligent Vehicle Evaluations
              (DECISIVE) project by the University of Massachusetts Lowell for evaluating small unmanned aerial systems (sUAS) performance in subterranean and constrained indoor 
              environments, spanning communications, field readiness, interface, obstacle avoidance, navigation, mapping, autonomy, trust, and situation awareness. For sUAS 
              deployment in subterranean and constrained indoor environments, this puts forth two assumptions about applicable sUAS to be evaluated using these test methods: (1) 
              able to operate without access to GPS signal, and (2) width from prop top to prop tip does not exceed 91 cm (36 in) wide (i.e., can physically fit through a typical 
              doorway, although successful navigation through is not guaranteed). All test methods are specified using a common format: Purpose, Summary of Test Method, Apparatus 
              and Artifacts, Equipment, Metrics, Procedure, and Example Data. All test methods are designed to be run in real-world environments (e.g., MOUT sites) or using 
              fabricated apparatuses (e.g., test bays built from wood, or contained inside of one or more shipping containers).

              This report reviews all results derived from performance benchmarking conducted during Phase I of the Development and Execution of Comprehensive and Integrated 
            Subterranean Intelligent Vehicle Evaluations (DECISIVE) project by the University of Massachusetts Lowell, using the test methods specified in the DECISIVE Test 
            \Methods Handbook v1.1 for evaluating small unmanned aerial systems (sUAS) performance in subterranean and constrained indoor environments, spanning communications, 
            field readiness, interface, obstacle avoidance, navigation, mapping, autonomy, trust, and situation awareness. Using those 20 test methods, over 230 tests were 
            conducted across 8 sUAS platforms: Cleo Robotics Dronut X1P (P = prototype), FLIR Black Hornet PRS, Flyability Elios 2 GOV, Lumenier Nighthawk V3, Parrot ANAFI USA 
            GOV, Skydio X2D, Teal Golden Eagle, and Vantage Robotics Vesper. Best in class criteria is specified for each applicable test method and the sUAS that match this 
            criteria are named for each test method, including a high-level executive summary of their performance.

              Evaluation of Navigation and Trajectory-following Capabilities of Small Unmanned Aerial Systems (<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10025455">https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10025455</a>)

              Use cases for Small Unmanned Aerial Systems (sUAS) have expanded significantly over the past few years. One use case that is relevant to both civilian and defense 
            missions is reliable operation in GPS-denied indoor and subterranean (subT) environments such as urban underground, tunnel systems, and cave networks. While many 
            sUAS evaluation studies exist for outdoor environments, there have been limited studies to evaluate the characteristics of sUAS in GPS-denied indoor and subT 
            environments. This paper attempts to resolve this knowledge gap by presenting a methodology for evaluating the navigation performance of sUAS in such environments, 
            including operations such as waypoint navigation, path traversal, trajectory keeping, and navigation around corners. Specifically, we determine and present results 
            for the navigation performance of five commercially available sUAS via the presented evaluation methodology.

              The integration of the cyber-network with the physical power grid makes it prone to cyber-attacks disrupting the normal operation of the grid and therefore 
            critical to detect. This paper compares how the detection of Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS) attacks, one of the most common types of cyber-attack, on 
            smart grids varies depending on the Machine Learning (ML) method used for detection, the different datasets used for the training, and the features of the 
            dataset incorporated in the training. The most commonly used datasets namely KDDCup’99 and CICIDS’17 datasets are adapted for the sake of testing. The different 
            ML methods used for these experiments are Decision Tree, Random Forest, Quadratic Discriminant Analysis, Support Vector Machine, Naïve Bayes, and Extreme Gradient 
            Boosting. With extensive comparison analyses among the ML models based on accuracy, computation time, and storage usage, the paper demonstrates the applicability 
            of the models in smart grids.

            <p>
              Test Methodologies for Evaluating the Effectiveness of sUAS Communication Links for Operation in Indoor and Subterranean Environments
            </p>
             
            <p>
              This article presents a set of nondestructive test methodologies designed to evaluate and com- pare performance of the communication links used for control and 
              telemetry of small un- manned aircraft systems (sUAS) (drones) that are operating indoors and in subterranean environments. Such a set of standardized test 
              methodologies does not yet exist. Indoor and subterranean operation requires sUAS to operate without global positioning system and often in a spatially constrained 
              non-line-of-sight (NLOS) communication environment. Operating in constrained indoor environments puts additional constraints on the communica- tion links and 
              requires a set of tests to allow evaluation and comparison of different units in typical scenarios that will be encountered. Tests to measure and compare 
              communication link performance and ability to pilot in tunnels and office type buildings with doors, walls, and other obstructions, as well as stairwells are 
              described. The test methods consist of measuring and comparing the NLOS radio range between the sUAS and the ground control station or operator control unit (OCU), 
              observing the sUAS behavior with partial or total communication failure. Near the edge of coverage, correlated packet loss can lead to difficulties in piloting. 
              A meth- odology for evaluating video latency that is critical for remote piloting by camera only is pre- sented. Finally, a test methodology for characterizing 
              the effects of interference and jamming by waveforms such as Wi-Fi often encountered in buildings is described. These test method- ologies described here extend 
              standards developed for ground robots to three dimensions. The test methodologies described in this article are part of a multifaceted project that evaluates many 
              essential elements of drone operation indoors. These include communication, navigation, collision tolerance, mapping, trust, and automation. The test methodologies 
              are designed to be reproduced in user facilities.

              Thesis Topic: Robust Optimization for Reinforcement Learning. Current state of the art has the requirement S and SA Rectangularity in Robust Markov Decision Process
               as a condition of convergence. We want to expand this to see if rectangularity in only a portion of MDP is enough to guarantee convergence.

              Honors Thesis related to maximizing the processing of depth maps by converting a Python Multi-Processed settup into a CPP script using multi-threading.
              Multi-threading and CPP allow the code to run faster. Multi-threading beats out mult-processing becasue of the decreased overhead time cost and the 
              fact that all inter-thread messaging is in the same state space. Python cannot benefit from this due to the global interpreter lock that it has. CPP in
              general runs faster than Python due to its compilation is considerably faster.

            <h3> Goal</h3>
            <p>
              Along side my friend we developed this project on our own in our Freshman year (Fall 2018). This project was started to aid visually impaired people to navigate
              and not collide into walls. It initially used lidar distance measurement and now uses depthmapping to understand the surrounds and tell a user where obstacles are 
              that would be a risk to them actively while moving forward.

            <h2> Founding of the Drone Club </h2>
            
            <p> Alongside Derek Houle I founded the Umass Lowell Drone Club in our Freshman year of undergrad (Spring 2019).</p>

            <h2> Goals of the Club</h2>
            <p>
              This club was founded to expand students ability to learn and to build drones at UML. I started building drones as a kid with my father and I wanted to teach
              my peers the same joys. We build many drones over the 4 years I was president of the club. We built them for fun or for Professors. This could not have been done
               without our advisor Professor Jean-Francois Millithaler. We built drones all through the pandemic even if we were shipping parts from one house to another across 
              Massachusetts. The new President is Gabriel Carbalho.
            </p>
            <h2> Videos of the School </h2>
            <p> We made videos of the school to show students who could not come in person what Umass Lowell looks like. The pandemic made it hard for students to come
            and walk the halls and see the campus. The videos we generated will help many classes of students see the school the way we saw it before the pandemic.
