            <p>
              DECISIVE Test Methods Handbook: Test Methods for Evaluating sUAS in Subterranean and Constrained Indoor Environments, Version 1.1 (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01801">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01801</a>)
            </p>
            <p>
              This handbook outlines all test methods developed under the Development and Execution of Comprehensive and Integrated Subterranean Intelligent Vehicle Evaluations
              (DECISIVE) project by the University of Massachusetts Lowell for evaluating small unmanned aerial systems (sUAS) performance in subterranean and constrained indoor 
              environments, spanning communications, field readiness, interface, obstacle avoidance, navigation, mapping, autonomy, trust, and situation awareness. For sUAS 
              deployment in subterranean and constrained indoor environments, this puts forth two assumptions about applicable sUAS to be evaluated using these test methods: (1) 
              able to operate without access to GPS signal, and (2) width from prop top to prop tip does not exceed 91 cm (36 in) wide (i.e., can physically fit through a typical 
              doorway, although successful navigation through is not guaranteed). All test methods are specified using a common format: Purpose, Summary of Test Method, Apparatus 
              and Artifacts, Equipment, Metrics, Procedure, and Example Data. All test methods are designed to be run in real-world environments (e.g., MOUT sites) or using 
              fabricated apparatuses (e.g., test bays built from wood, or contained inside of one or more shipping containers).

              This report reviews all results derived from performance benchmarking conducted during Phase I of the Development and Execution of Comprehensive and Integrated 
            Subterranean Intelligent Vehicle Evaluations (DECISIVE) project by the University of Massachusetts Lowell, using the test methods specified in the DECISIVE Test 
            \Methods Handbook v1.1 for evaluating small unmanned aerial systems (sUAS) performance in subterranean and constrained indoor environments, spanning communications, 
            field readiness, interface, obstacle avoidance, navigation, mapping, autonomy, trust, and situation awareness. Using those 20 test methods, over 230 tests were 
            conducted across 8 sUAS platforms: Cleo Robotics Dronut X1P (P = prototype), FLIR Black Hornet PRS, Flyability Elios 2 GOV, Lumenier Nighthawk V3, Parrot ANAFI USA 
            GOV, Skydio X2D, Teal Golden Eagle, and Vantage Robotics Vesper. Best in class criteria is specified for each applicable test method and the sUAS that match this 
            criteria are named for each test method, including a high-level executive summary of their performance.

              Evaluation of Navigation and Trajectory-following Capabilities of Small Unmanned Aerial Systems (<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10025455">https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10025455</a>)

              Use cases for Small Unmanned Aerial Systems (sUAS) have expanded significantly over the past few years. One use case that is relevant to both civilian and defense 
            missions is reliable operation in GPS-denied indoor and subterranean (subT) environments such as urban underground, tunnel systems, and cave networks. While many 
            sUAS evaluation studies exist for outdoor environments, there have been limited studies to evaluate the characteristics of sUAS in GPS-denied indoor and subT 
            environments. This paper attempts to resolve this knowledge gap by presenting a methodology for evaluating the navigation performance of sUAS in such environments, 
            including operations such as waypoint navigation, path traversal, trajectory keeping, and navigation around corners. Specifically, we determine and present results 
            for the navigation performance of five commercially available sUAS via the presented evaluation methodology.

              The integration of the cyber-network with the physical power grid makes it prone to cyber-attacks disrupting the normal operation of the grid and therefore 
            critical to detect. This paper compares how the detection of Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS) attacks, one of the most common types of cyber-attack, on 
            smart grids varies depending on the Machine Learning (ML) method used for detection, the different datasets used for the training, and the features of the 
            dataset incorporated in the training. The most commonly used datasets namely KDDCup’99 and CICIDS’17 datasets are adapted for the sake of testing. The different 
            ML methods used for these experiments are Decision Tree, Random Forest, Quadratic Discriminant Analysis, Support Vector Machine, Naïve Bayes, and Extreme Gradient 
            Boosting. With extensive comparison analyses among the ML models based on accuracy, computation time, and storage usage, the paper demonstrates the applicability 
            of the models in smart grids.

            <p>
              Test Methodologies for Evaluating the Effectiveness of sUAS Communication Links for Operation in Indoor and Subterranean Environments
            </p>
             
            <p>
              This article presents a set of nondestructive test methodologies designed to evaluate and com- pare performance of the communication links used for control and 
              telemetry of small un- manned aircraft systems (sUAS) (drones) that are operating indoors and in subterranean environments. Such a set of standardized test 
              methodologies does not yet exist. Indoor and subterranean operation requires sUAS to operate without global positioning system and often in a spatially constrained 
              non-line-of-sight (NLOS) communication environment. Operating in constrained indoor environments puts additional constraints on the communica- tion links and 
              requires a set of tests to allow evaluation and comparison of different units in typical scenarios that will be encountered. Tests to measure and compare 
              communication link performance and ability to pilot in tunnels and office type buildings with doors, walls, and other obstructions, as well as stairwells are 
              described. The test methods consist of measuring and comparing the NLOS radio range between the sUAS and the ground control station or operator control unit (OCU), 
              observing the sUAS behavior with partial or total communication failure. Near the edge of coverage, correlated packet loss can lead to difficulties in piloting. 
              A meth- odology for evaluating video latency that is critical for remote piloting by camera only is pre- sented. Finally, a test methodology for characterizing 
              the effects of interference and jamming by waveforms such as Wi-Fi often encountered in buildings is described. These test method- ologies described here extend 
              standards developed for ground robots to three dimensions. The test methodologies described in this article are part of a multifaceted project that evaluates many 
              essential elements of drone operation indoors. These include communication, navigation, collision tolerance, mapping, trust, and automation. The test methodologies 
              are designed to be reproduced in user facilities.

              Honors Thesis related to maximizing the processing of depth maps by converting a Python Multi-Processed settup into a CPP script using multi-threading.
              Multi-threading and CPP allow the code to run faster. Multi-threading beats out mult-processing becasue of the decreased overhead time cost and the 
              fact that all inter-thread messaging is in the same state space. Python cannot benefit from this due to the global interpreter lock that it has. CPP in
              general runs faster than Python due to its compilation is considerably faster.
